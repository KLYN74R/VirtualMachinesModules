# Modules to extend the behaviour of KLYNTAR VM based on WASM

Soon we'll add more info how to write modules on any language which compiled to WASM. Or, it might be JS code. These modules can use "host" logic e.g. hash tables, remote storage, network calls, using API and so on.

Developers who created smart-contracts on AssemblyScript, Rust, C++ and other WASM compatible langs can import these functions. We can make these modules payable(energy cost), you can use our own metrics(which will be used by nodes and validators) and so on


## Coming soon!
It was a brief info, we'll add more very-very soon :)
